**Software Testing Fundamentals**


* **Verification** -- Are you buildiing it right ?
    - It's performed while building the system, and generally performed by devloper.
    - It can be done by reviewing the code, unit testing, and integration testing.
    - Aim is to implement in correct way as per requirements.
* **Validation** -- Have you build it right?
    - Its perform after building the system, and generally performed by tester.
    - It can be done by using System testing.
    - Aim is to find the bugs, make system error free.
 
**Types of testing**

1. Unit Testing ( Tier/Level-1 Testing)
    - Testing is performed by developers, and smalll units(generally methods) are tested on various inputs.
    - Test is performed on individual blocks/small chunks of code.
    - Unit testing does not guarantee that, in future there won't be any bugs/failures.
    - It is done with whitebox testing mechanism
      
2. Integration Testing -- 
   - Testing is performed on integrated units by combining all the components, like multiple services.
   - Its generally performed by testers, sometimes devs.
   - It is done with whitebox testing mechanism.
   a. Bang Bang
   b. Top Down
   c. Bottom Up
   d. Mixed (Sandwich)

3. System Testing 
   - Full testing of system, includes functional and non-functional requirements.
   - Validates fully integrated system, and tests end to end requirements.
   - It is done with blackbox testing mechanism.
   - 
     a. **Based on who is performing testing** (Functional)
       - **Alpha** (Usually tested in-house. by dev, testers).
       - **Beta** ( Kind of UAT, done with limited external users).
       - **Acceptance** (end user (customers) tests the system).
     b. **Based on Performance Testing** (Non-Functional)
        - Volume
        - Load
        - Stress
        - Security
        - Configuration
        - Compatibility
        - Recovery
        - Installation
    
6. Regression Testing
   - Ensures that new code changes do not negatively affect the existing functionality of the application.
   - 

**Black Box Testing Vs White Box Testing**
    - These are techniques to design test cases.
    - 

* **Error Seeding in Software Testing**
  - 

* **Cyclomatic Complexity**


* **Cohesion and Coupling**
  - Cohesion -- Talks about within module
    - A System should have high cohesion.
  - Coupling -- Talks about b/w modules
    - A System should have low coupling.
   
* Types of cohesion

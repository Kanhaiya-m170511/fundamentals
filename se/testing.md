**Software Testing Fundamentals**


* **Verification** -- Are you buildiing it right ?
    - It's performed while building the system, and generally performed by devloper.
    - It can be done by reviewing the code, unit testing, and integration testing.
    - Aim is to implement in correct way as per requirements.
* **Validation** -- Have you build it right?
    - Its perform after building the system, and generally performed by tester.
    - It can be done by using System testing.
    - Aim is to find the bugs, make system error free.
 
**Types of testing**

1. Unit Testing
    - Testing is performed by developers, and smalll units(generally methods) are tested on various inputs.
    - 
2. Integration Testing --
   - Testing is performed on integrated units, like multiple services.
   - 
   a. Bang Bang
   b. Top Down
   c. Bottom Up
   d. Mixed

3. System Testing
   - Full testing of system, includes functional and non-functional requirements.
   - 
     a. **Based on who is performing testing** (Functional)
       - **Alpha** (Usually tested in house. by dev, testers).
       - **Beta** ( Kind of UAT, done with limited external users).
       - **Acceptance** ( User tests the system).
     b. **Based on Performance Testing** (Non-Functional)
        - Volume
        - Load
        - Stress
        - Security
        - Configuration
        - Compatibility
        - Recovery
        - Installation
    
6. Regression Testing
   - Ensures that new code changes do not negatively affect the existing functionality of the application.
